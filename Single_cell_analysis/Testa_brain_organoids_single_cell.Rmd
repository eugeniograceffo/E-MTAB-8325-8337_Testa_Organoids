## Intro

```{r}
## Load libraries
library(Seurat)
library(ggplot2)
library(SingleR)
library(dplyr)
library(patchwork)
#library(celldex)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
#library(DropletUtils)
#library(usethis)
library(tidyverse)
library(sctransform)
#library(Matrix.utils)
```

```{r}
## Load dataset
mat <- Read10X("~/OneDrive - Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin/Schuelke_Lab/EG15_RNA_Seq/Brain_organoids_scRNA_Seq/cell_ranger_files")

dimnames(mat)
```

```{r}
## Create Seurat object
srat <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = mat, project = "organoids") 

#srat <- readRDS(file = "~/OneDrive - Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin/Schuelke_Lab/EG15_RNA_Seq/Brain_organoids_scRNA_Seq/outputs/cortical_organoids_results.rds") # reload if saved
srat
```

```{r}
## Have a look
mat <- NULL # saves RAM
str(srat)

meta <- srat@meta.data
dim(meta)
head(meta)

```


## Quality Control
```{r}
## Let's do some QC
#mitochondrial contamination
srat[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(srat, pattern = "^MT-")

# ribosomial protein (RPS or RPL)
srat[["percent.rb"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(srat, pattern = "^RP[SL]")

head(srat@meta.data, 5)
```
```{r}
# Visualize QC metrics as a violin plot
VlnPlot(srat, features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt","percent.rb"), ncol = 4)

## looking at data, I would set 500<nFeature<9000 , perc.mt<12
```
```{r}
# FeatureScatter is typically used to visualize feature-feature relationships, but can be used
# for anything calculated by the object, i.e. columns in object metadata, PC scores etc.

## Let's have a look at some correlations

FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mt") + geom_hline(yintercept=12, linetype="dashed", color = "blue")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA") + geom_hline(yintercept=9000, linetype="dashed", color = "blue") + geom_hline(yintercept=500, linetype="dashed", color = "blue")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.rb")

# as expected, higher mt % correlates with low counts ie dead cells
```

```{r}
## apply filters
srat <- subset(srat, subset = nFeature_RNA > 500 & nFeature_RNA < 9000 & percent.mt < 12)
```

## Normalization 

After removing unwanted cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the feature expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result. Normalized values are stored in pbmc[["RNA"]]@data.

```{r}
## Let's normalize
srat <- NormalizeData(srat, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
```

## Feature Selection

```{r}
##Let's find the most variable features(genes) to use downstream
srat <- FindVariableFeatures(srat, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

# Identify the 10 most highly variable genes
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(srat), 10)
top10

# plot variable features with and without labels
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(srat)
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE, xnudge = 0, ynudge = 0)

plot1
plot2
```
## Scaling

Next, we apply a linear transformation (‘scaling’) that is a standard pre-processing step prior to dimensional reduction techniques like PCA. The ScaleData() function:

-Shifts the expression of each gene, so that the mean expression across cells is 0
-Scales the expression of each gene, so that the variance across cells is 1
-This step gives equal weight in downstream analyses, so that highly-expressed genes do not dominate
-The results of this are stored in pbmc[["RNA"]]@scale.data

```{r}
all.genes <- rownames(srat)
srat <- ScaleData(srat, features = all.genes)
```



## Regress out Cell cycles
First, we assign each cell a score, based on its expression of G2/M and S phase markers. These marker sets should be anticorrelated in their expression levels, and cells expressing neither are likely not cycling and in G1 phase.

We assign scores in the CellCycleScoring() function, which stores S and G2/M scores in object meta data, along with the predicted classification of each cell in either G2M, S or G1 phase. CellCycleScoring() can also set the identity of the Seurat object to the cell-cycle phase by passing set.ident = TRUE (the original identities are stored as old.ident). Please note that Seurat does not use the discrete classifications (G2M/G1/S) in downstream cell cycle regression. Instead, it uses the quantitative scores for G2M and S phase. However, we provide our predicted classifications in case they are of interest.

```{r}
# Calculate the cell state based on cell cycle markers
s.genes <- cc.genes.updated.2019$s.genes
g2m.genes <- cc.genes.updated.2019$g2m.genes

srat <- CellCycleScoring(srat, s.features = s.genes, g2m.features = g2m.genes, set.ident = TRUE)
table(srat[[]]$Phase)
```
```{r}
# Visualize the distribution of cell cycle markers across
RidgePlot(srat, features = c("PCNA", "TOP2A", "MCM6", "MKI67"), ncol = 2)
```

```{r}
# Running a PCA on cell cycle genes reveals, unsurprisingly, that cells separate entirely by phase

srat <- RunPCA(srat, features = c(s.genes, g2m.genes))
DimPlot(srat)
```
### Normal regression for normal datasets
```{r}
# Let's regress it out
#srat <- ScaleData(srat, vars.to.regress = c("S.Score", "G2M.Score"), features = rownames(srat))

```

### Regression in developmental dataset
The procedure above removes all signal associated with cell cycle. In some cases, we’ve found that this can negatively impact downstream analysis, particularly in differentiating processes (like murine hematopoiesis), where stem cells are quiescent and differentiated cells are proliferating (or vice versa). In this case, regressing out all cell cycle effects can blur the distinction between stem and progenitor cells as well.

As an alternative, we suggest regressing out the difference between the G2M and S phase scores. This means that signals separating non-cycling cells and cycling cells will be maintained, but differences in cell cycle phase among proliferating cells (which are often uninteresting), will be regressed out of the data

```{r}
## done on server, takes >4h
srat$CC.Difference <- srat$S.Score - srat$G2M.Score
srat <- ScaleData(srat, vars.to.regress = "CC.Difference", features = rownames(srat))
```
```{r}
## reload and visual inspection
srat <- readRDS(file = "~/OneDrive - Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin/Schuelke_Lab/EG15_RNA_Seq/Brain_organoids_scRNA_Seq/outputs/cortical_organoids_cell_cycle_regressed_out.rds") 

```

```{r}
# Running a PCA on cell cycle genes again, to visualize the effects of regression

srat <- RunPCA(srat, features = c(s.genes, g2m.genes))
DimPlot(srat)
```


## Linear dimensionality reduction

```{r}
srat <- RunPCA(srat, features = VariableFeatures(object = srat))
```

```{r}
# Visualize the PC loadings

VizDimLoadings(srat, dims = 1:9, reduction = "pca") & 
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=5), axis.title=element_text(size=8,face="bold"))
```
```{r}
# Visualize the heatmaps
DimHeatmap(srat, dims = 1:15, nfeatures = 20, cells = 500, balanced = T)

```

```{r}
## Let's assess how many PC we need for clustering

ElbowPlot(srat)
```
The first big drop is at 10. We will start by using this value for clustering
After regressing out cell cycle, elbow is at 9

## Clustering
```{r}
srat <- FindNeighbors(srat, dims = 1:9) # 10 from before
srat <- FindClusters(srat, resolution = 0.5)
```
### non-linear dimensional reduction UMAP

```{r}
srat <- RunUMAP(srat, dims = 1:9, verbose = F)
table(srat@meta.data$seurat_clusters)  #shows the size of each cluster

#Let's plot the UMAP
DimPlot(srat,label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)
```
```{r}
## Intermediate file save
saveRDS(srat, file = "~/OneDrive - Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin/Schuelke_Lab/EG15_RNA_Seq/Brain_organoids_scRNA_Seq/outputs/cortical_organoids_cell_cycle_regressed_out.rds")
```
